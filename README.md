# React Portfolio Site HW 20

## Description 
---
Aside from being the Week 20 Challenge, the task was to create a portfolio website that would showcase our understanding of React, different projects that we have completed/are working on, a method for users to contact us, and some information about myself + resume.

## Installation
---
The following commands will need to be run in the user's terminal, with the exception of the last one, which is a program:

1) npm i --> to download necessary modules in the root, client, and server folders respectively

2) npm start --> run local server

The following packages were used: 
- "@emailjs/browser": "^3.10.0",
- "@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons": "^6.2.1",
- "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons": "^6.2.1",
- "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome": "^0.2.0",
- "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
- "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
- "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
- "animate.css": "^4.1.1",
- "gsap-trial": "^3.9.0",
- "loaders.css": "^0.1.2",
- "react": "^18.2.0",
- "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
- "react-leaflet": "^4.2.0",
- "react-loaders": "^3.0.1",
- "react-router-dom": "^6.6.2",
- "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
- "sass": "^1.57.1",
- "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"

## Usage 
---
In theory, someone who is interested in speaking to me about a project/work can look at this react website and gauge me and my understanding of coding/writing.

## Credits

Aside from my instructor and T.A., there were several YouTube tutorial videos which proved extremely helpful in making this.
